**Topic:** The Foundations

## 🔐 Cybersecurity – Definition

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, damage, or disruption.  
It involves using technologies, processes, and best practices to ensure **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of information.

# Benefits of Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is essential in protecting digital systems, data, and networks. Its benefits include:

## 1. Protection of Sensitive Data

- Safeguards personal, financial, and business information.
- Prevents data breaches and identity theft.

## 2. Maintains Business Continuity

- Reduces downtime caused by cyber attacks.
- Ensures smooth operations of critical systems.

## 3. Prevents Financial Loss

- Protects against cyber fraud and ransomware.
- Avoids the costs associated with data breaches and recovery.

## 4. Enhances Customer Trust

- Demonstrates commitment to data privacy and security.
- Builds confidence among clients and stakeholders.

## 5. Compliance with Regulations

- Helps meet legal and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- Avoids penalties and legal issues.

## 6. Protection Against Cyber Threats

- Guards against malware, phishing, and hacking attempts.
- Reduces the risk of system compromise.

## 7. Safeguards Reputation

- Prevents damage to brand image caused by breaches.
- Maintains public and stakeholder trust.

## 8. Encourages Safe Digital Practices

- Promotes awareness and training for employees.
- Helps users follow security best practices.

## 🔐 The 8 Security Domains

1. **Security & Risk Management**  
   Focuses on identifying, analyzing, and managing risks to information assets.  
   Includes policies, governance, compliance, and business continuity.

2. **Asset Security**  
   Deals with protecting organizational data throughout its lifecycle.  
   Includes data classification, handling, storage, and disposal.

3. **Security Architecture & Engineering**  
   Involves designing and implementing secure systems and infrastructure.  
   Includes secure design principles, cryptography, and physical security.

4. **Communication & Network Security**  
   Focuses on securing data during transmission across networks.  
   Includes firewalls, VPNs, IDS/IPS, and secure network protocols.

5. **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**  
   Ensures only authorized users can access systems and data.  
   Includes authentication, authorization, MFA, and access controls.

6. **Security Assessment & Testing**  
   Focuses on evaluating security controls to identify vulnerabilities.  
   Includes penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and audits.

7. **Security Operations**  
   Involves monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents.  
   Includes SOC operations, incident response, logging, and monitoring.

8. **Software Development Security**  
   Focuses on integrating security into the software development lifecycle.  
   Includes secure coding, code reviews, and application security testing.
